# If the GENERATE_HTMLHELP tag is set to YES then doxygen generates three

# (see: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21138) on
# Windows.

# The HTML Help Workshop contains a compiler that can convert all HTML output
# generated by doxygen into a single compiled HTML file (.chm). Compiled HTML
# files are now used as the Windows 98 help format, and will replace the old

# it. Since the tabs in the index contain the same information as the navigation

# (i.e. any modern browser). Windows users are probably better off using the
# HTML help feature. Via custom stylesheets (see HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET) one can
# further fine-tune the look of the index. As an example, the default style
# sheet generated by doxygen has an example that shows how to put an image at
# the root of the tree instead of the PROJECT_NAME. Since the tree basically has
